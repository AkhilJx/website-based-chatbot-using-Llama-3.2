# website-based-chatbot-using-Llama-3.2
A chatbot where we can ask queries based on a given website and get the corresponding answers from the website. 

The chatbot is built using streamlet Python. 
The user is provided with a space to enter the website from which he/she wishes to acquire knowledge. 
After entering the website link, they can enter the question to be asked to the model based on the website.
If the user asks anything outside the website, the LLM chatbot will return "I don't know." Otherwise, it will return the corresponding output.
The user can click the "clear" button if he/she wishes to provide a new website URL.

A Screenshot of the output is as shown:
